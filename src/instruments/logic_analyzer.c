 * @brief High-level driver for the PSLab's Logic Analyzer instrument
 * @details
 * # Implementation
 *
 * The logic analyzer uses the following resources:
 *
 * ## Pins LA1-4
 *
 * When the logic level on an active pin changes, a timestamp is stored in the
 * sample buffer. Three types of logic level changes (edges) can be captured:
 * ANY, FALLING, or RISING.
 *
 * If the configured edge type is ANY, a timestamp is stored every time the
 * logic level changes from low to high, or from high to low.
 *
 * If the configured edge type is RISING, a timestamp is stored every time the
 * logic level changes from low to high, but not from high to low. Vice versa
 * for edge type FALLING.
 *
 * Up to 10k timestamps can be captured, across all four channels.
 *
 * ## Input Capture (IC) channels IC1-4
 *
 * Each ICx channel is associated with the corresponding LAx pin. When the
 * configured edge type is detected on LAx, the current value of ICxTMR is
 * copied to ICxBUF.
 *
 * IC interrupt is used to trigger delayed capture, if edge type is FALLING or
 * RISING. If edge type is ANY, delayed capture is instead triggered by CN.
 *
 * ## Input Change Notification (CN)
 *
 * One pin may be designated as the trigger pin, in which case capture begins
 * when the configured edge type is detected on that pin. If no pin is selected
 * as trigger, capture begins immediatedely.
 *
 * If the edge type is ANY, CN interrupt is used to start capture. If the edge
 * type is FALLING or RISING, IC interrupt is used instead.
 *
 * When using delayed capture, there is no timeout. If the trigger edge never
 * occurs on the trigger pin, capture does not start. The instrument must be
 * reset by calling `LA_stop`.
 *
 * ## Timer TMR5
 *
 * When the trigger condition is met, TMR5 is started. TMR5 is used as trigger
 * source to start the enabled IC channels' ICxTMR, as well as clock source to
 * clock the same.
 *
 * ## Direct Memory Access (DMA) channels DMA0-3
 *
 * ICx drives DMA(x-1). Every time a new value is copied to ICxBUF, DMA(x-1)
 * copies it to the sample buffer.
 *
 * When the requested number of timestamps have been captured on LAx, DMA(x-1)
 * interrupts and resets itself and ICx. If ICx is the last active channel,
 * TMR5 is reset.
 *
 * ## Sample Buffer
 *
 * Captured timestamps are stored in the sample buffer.
